- 👋 Hi, I’m @TomHildebrand
- 👀 I’m interested in IoT, ESP32, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning BLE for ESP32
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on using an IoT controller (ESP32, RPi) to acquire sensor data from multiple BLE GATT servers, in particular voltages and currents from RV components (solar charger, batteries, battery combiner etc).
